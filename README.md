## Summary

[Enter The Warp!]: https://wahapedia.ru/

Hello, My name is Kayne Harris.  I am a student at New Tech Institute as well as at the Southern Indiana Career and Technical Center.  I aspire to enter a field that includes computers, some in computer science, others not; like a meteorologist, IT specialist, or a cybersecurity specialist.  Although software interests me, I find that it frustrates me and I want to focus on the hardware side of things.
